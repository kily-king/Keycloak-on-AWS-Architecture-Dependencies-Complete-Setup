============================
Metrics (CPU, Latency, Request Count)

Where are the application and node metrics configured?

Which Prometheus scrape configs are used for this service?

Which exporter provides CPU/memory metrics?

Which Grafana dashboard panels show latency and request counts?

How is latency calculated (histogram, summary, percentiles)?

Are SLO/SLA alerts configured for these metrics?

Logs (Application Logs)

Where are logs collected from (path, container stdout, filebeat config)?

Which log format do the applications use (JSON, plain text)?

Which log pipeline processes them (Filebeat, Fluentd, Loki)?

Where are logs stored â Loki/Elastic/Cloud provider?

How do we correlate logs with traces?

Traces (Distributed Tracing)

Which OpenTelemetry SDK or agent is enabled?

How is context propagation handled across microservices?

Where are traces exported (OTLP â collector â backend)?

Which dashboards show request flow between services?

Native Tools for Logs/Traces

Which native tools are enabled (Fluentd, CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Azure Monitor)?

Whatâs the retention period for native logs?

How do native traces integrate with OpenTelemetry?

Datadog

Which Datadog agents are installed?

Which tags/labels are used for service discovery?

Which dashboards show latency, error rate, throughput?

How are alerts configured in Datadog?

Latency, Error Rate, Request Flow Charts

Where are RED (Rate-Errors-Duration) metrics configured?

Which Grafana/Datadog dashboards show service dependencies?

How is error rate calculated (5xx/4xx filters)?

Are there multi-hop request flow traces available?

Production Hardening (TLS, Batching, Load Balancing Collectors)

Is TLS termination done at the app, sidecar, or collector?

Are collectors horizontally scaled with load balancing?

Are metrics/traces batched before export?

How do we handle backpressure on collectors?

OTLP Receivers (gRPC/HTTP)

Which OTLP protocol is enabled (gRPC/HTTP)?

Which port numbers are used for OTLP receivers?

How is authentication handled for OTLP endpoints?

How does the collector route data to backends?

Java Auto-Instrumentation

Which version of the OpenTelemetry Java agent is used?

Where is the agent configured (JVM args, startup script)?

Which exporters are enabled for metrics/logs/traces?

Are any custom instrumentations added?

Grafana Dashboards

Which dashboards show trace â log â metric correlation?

How are service KPIs visualized (latency/error-rate)?

Who owns dashboard updates?

Are alerts linked to dashboards?

Kubernetes Service Discovery

How does k8s service discovery pick up apps (annotations, labels)?

Which namespaces are monitored?

Are sidecar collectors used or DaemonSets?

How do we validate that new services automatically appear in metrics/traces?
