✅ TOP AWS OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (2025)

⸻

1. What is AWS Observability? How is it different from Monitoring?

Answer:
	•	Monitoring = Tracking known metrics & logs to detect known issues (CPU, memory, latency).
	•	Observability = Understanding why something is happening by correlating logs + metrics + traces across distributed systems.
	•	AWS Observability uses:
	•	CloudWatch → Metrics, logs, alarms
	•	X-Ray → Distributed tracing
	•	CloudTrail → API activity
	•	OpenTelemetry (OTEL) → Vendor-neutral data collection
	•	AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)

Monitoring answers “Is the system healthy?”
Observability answers “Why is it behaving this way?”

⸻

2. What are the core pillars of AWS Observability?

Answer:
	1.	Metrics (CloudWatch, Container Insights, Custom metrics)
	2.	Logs (CloudWatch Logs, Lambda Logs, VPC Flow, Load Balancer Access Logs)
	3.	Traces (AWS X-Ray, ADOT)
	4.	Events (CloudWatch Events / EventBridge)
	5.	User Experience Monitoring (CloudWatch Synthetics)

⸻

3. What is the best practice architecture for AWS Observability implementation?

Answer:

Best implementation includes:

✔ Central CloudWatch Dashboard for all accounts using AWS Organizations
✔ ADOT collectors for microservices
✔ CloudWatch Alarms + SNS + Slack/Teams integration
✔ X-Ray tracing + Service Map
✔ Centralized Logging via S3 + CloudWatch + Kinesis Firehose
✔ VPC Flow Logs + Load Balancer Logs enabled by default
✔ AWS Config + Security Hub for compliance observability
✔ Cost & Performance dashboards for optimization

⸻

4. How do you implement end-to-end tracing in AWS?

Answer:

Use AWS X-Ray or ADOT (OpenTelemetry):
	1.	Enable X-Ray tracing on:
	•	Lambda
	•	API Gateway
	•	ECS/EKS tasks (daemon set)
	•	Step Functions
	•	App Mesh
	2.	Add OTEL SDK to applications
	3.	View:
	•	Segment documents
	•	Service map
	•	Latency breakdown
	4.	Send traces to CloudWatch ServiceLens

This helps detect performance bottlenecks, cold starts, and slow DB queries.

⸻

5. What are best practices for CloudWatch metrics design?

Answer:

✔ Use standard metrics (CPU, network, latency, errors)
✔ Add custom metrics for business KPIs
✔ Group metrics using metric filters
✔ Use high-resolution metrics (1s) for latency-sensitive apps
✔ Implement anomaly detection for dynamic workloads

⸻

6. How do you design automated alerting in AWS?

Answer:
	1.	Create CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
	2.	Use multi-level alerting:
	•	Warning
	•	Critical
	•	Ops escalation
	3.	Send notifications through SNS → Slack/Email/Webhooks
	4.	Use Composite Alarms to reduce noise
	5.	Use EventBridge for automated remediation:
	•	Restart EC2
	•	Scale ECS service
	•	Trigger Lambda healing functions

⸻

7. What are CloudWatch Logs best practices?

Answer:

✔ Use structured logging (JSON)
✔ Enable log retention policies (not “Never Expire”)
✔ Use subscription filters to send logs to:
	•	S3
	•	Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
	•	SIEM tools (Splunk, QRadar)
✔ Enable VPC Flow Logs, ALB/NLB logs, WAF logs
✔ Implement Cross-account logging into central S3 bucket

⸻

8. What is AWS ServiceLens?

Answer:

ServiceLens combines:
	•	CloudWatch metrics
	•	CloudWatch logs
	•	X-Ray traces

Key benefits:
	•	One view of end-to-end performance
	•	Maps microservice dependencies
	•	Helps detect cold starts, latency spikes

⸻

9. How do you monitor EKS workloads in the best way?

Answer:
	1.	Use ADOT collector for metrics & traces
	2.	Enable Container Insights
	3.	Use Fluent Bit daemonset for log shipping
	4.	Enable Prometheus scraping (AMP – Amazon Managed Prometheus)
	5.	Use Grafana dashboards (Amazon Managed Grafana)

⸻

10. How do you secure observability data?

Answer:

✔ Encrypt logs using KMS
✔ Enable TLS for all logging agents
✔ Use VPC endpoints for CloudWatch/OTEL
✔ Restrict access using IAM least privilege
✔ Use S3 lifecycle policies for archived logs

⸻

11. How do you perform cost-optimized observability?

Answer:

AWS Observability can become costly; optimize by:

✔ Use log retention policies
✔ Compress logs in S3
✔ Use metric streams instead of thousands of custom metrics
✔ Use sampled tracing (not 100%)
✔ Archive old logs to Glacier

⸻

12. What is ADOT and why is it preferred?

Answer:

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) is AWS’s managed, vendor-neutral telemetry collector.

Benefits:
	•	Works with CloudWatch, X-Ray, Prometheus
	•	Open standard (no vendor lock-in)
	•	Easy to integrate with EKS, ECS, Lambda

⸻

13. What KPIs should always be monitored in cloud platforms?

Answer:

Technical KPIs
	•	Latency
	•	Error rate
	•	Request volume
	•	CPU/Memory usage
	•	Disk/IOPS
	•	Network throughput
	•	DB connections
	•	Queue length

Business KPIs
	•	Successful transactions
	•	Payment processing errors
	•	Login failures
	•	User engagement

⸻

14. How do you enable observability for a serverless architecture?

Answer:

✔ Enable CloudWatch Lambda Insights
✔ Enable detailed API Gateway logging
✔ Turn on X-Ray tracing for API + Lambda
✔ Use structured JSON logs
✔ Configure cold start alarms
✔ Use EventBridge Scheduler for periodic test calls

⸻

15. What tools do enterprises commonly use with AWS Observability?

Answer:
	•	Datadog
	•	Splunk
	•	Dynatrace
	•	Grafana + Prometheus
	•	Elastic / OpenSearch
	•	New Relic

AWS integrates with all via:
	•	Metric Streams
	•	Log Subscriptions
	•	OTEL collectors
