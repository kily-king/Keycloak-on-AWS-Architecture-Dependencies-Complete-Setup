Sure! I’ll prepare clear, strong, leadership-level answers for all 5 points based on best practices in Observability, Security Operations Maturity, and FinOps.
If you want them converted into a PPT, I can also generate that.

✅ Prepared Answers for All 5 Points


---

1) What metrics do we monitor currently?

A. Infrastructure Metrics

Compute: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O

Storage: IOPS, throughput, latency, usage

Kubernetes: node health, pod health, container restarts


B. Application Metrics

API latency, throughput, error rate (RED metrics)

Service dependencies & health

Transaction time & failure hotspots


C. Security Metrics

IAM anomalies (unusual logins, privilege escalation attempts)

GuardDuty findings

Vulnerability scan results

Compliance drift (CIS, internal benchmarks)


D. Cost & FinOps Metrics

Daily service-level cost

Idle resources

RI/Savings Plan utilization

Cost anomalies

Cost per environment (Dev/UAT/Prod)


E. Operational Metrics

Deployment success/failure rate

MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)

Incident volume & severity trends



---

2) Where do we derive these metrics from? (ODS, Grafana, Kibana, scripts)

Primary Sources

Grafana → real-time infra and application dashboards (Prometheus, CloudWatch datasource)

Kibana (ELK stack) → log aggregation, trace analysis, security events

ODS (Operational Data Store) → normalized operational data for reporting

CloudWatch / CloudTrail → native AWS monitoring & auditing

Prometheus → metrics scraping for microservices

Security Tools → GuardDuty, Inspector, Security Hub

Homegrown Scripts → cost extraction, custom log parsers, automated anomaly detection


Current State

Monitoring available but not fully unified

Some teams use scripts due to gaps in dashboards

Alert noise exists due to lack of correlation

Security, app and cost metrics are not yet integrated into a single pane of glass



---

3) What is our proposal going forward for observability?

A. Target Architecture

One unified observability platform integrating:

Metrics (Prometheus/CloudWatch)

Logs (OpenSearch/ELK)

Traces (OpenTelemetry)

Cost & security insights



B. Platform Enhancements

Service-level dashboards by default

Automated anomaly detection using ML

End-to-end distributed tracing

SLO/SLI monitoring for business KPIs

Unified alerting & correlation engine


C. Delivery Roadmap

1. Phase 1 – Standardize data sources, remove legacy scripts


2. Phase 2 – Implement distributed tracing for core services


3. Phase 3 – Unify dashboards for infra, app, cost, and security


4. Phase 4 – Introduce predictive analytics and automated event correlation



Outcome

Single pane of glass

Faster troubleshooting (reduced MTTR)

Improved reliability and operational efficiency



---

4) What is the meaning of maturing the security operations? What are current gaps? How do we fix?

Meaning of Maturing Security Operations

Moving from reactive to proactive security

Achieving consistent controls across all workloads

Automating remediation, compliance, and threat detection

Establishing measurable KPIs and governance


Current Gaps

1. Visibility gaps

Inconsistent logging coverage

No unified SIEM view



2. Manual processes

Manual vulnerability triage

Slow privilege reviews



3. Incident response gaps

No automated playbooks (SOAR)

IR runbooks not standardized



4. Compliance gaps

Drift from CIS/AWS security benchmarks




Fix Plan

Enable full log coverage + centralize into one SIEM

Deploy Security Hub as single compliance aggregator

Implement SOAR automation for:

Open ports

Misconfigurations

IAM anomalies


Define security maturity KPIs:

MTTR for security incidents

% automated remediations

Vulnerability SLA



Outcome

Predictive security posture

Reduced breaches & faster response

Audit-ready platform



---

5) How are we going to mature the FinOps platform? What tools are planned? What will we monitor?

A. FinOps Maturity Goal

Move from basic cost visibility → forecasting, optimization → automated cost governance.

B. Tools Proposed

AWS Cost Explorer → base visibility

AWS Billing & Cost Anomaly Detection

CloudZero / Apptio / FinOut (if enterprise tool planned)

Custom dashboards in Grafana/PowerBI

Automation scripts for tagging, idle cleanup


C. FinOps Capabilities to Mature

Accurate cost allocation by project/product

Automated idle resource detection

Commitment management (RI/SP planning & optimization)

Predictive forecasting

Cost governance policies (budget guardrails, automated enforcement)


D. What We Will Monitor

Service-level cost trends

Cost per environment

Resource utilization vs. cost

Cost anomalies

Tagging compliance

Unused/underutilized resources

ROI of optimization initiatives


Outcome

20–30% cost optimization opportunity

Transparent chargeback/showback model

Automated guardrails preventing overspend
